# COSC55 Final Project

**Due Date:** August 27th, 11:59 PM  
**Team Members:** Kevin Guo and Arnav Singh

Welcome to our COSC55 Final Project repository! This README provides an overview of our project, including its objectives, structure, and achievements.

## Project Overview

Our project focuses on designing, implementing, and securing a cloud-based application environment using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The goal is to simulate a real-world web application scenario where security, monitoring, and scalability are crucial for the maintaince and running of a website on the internet. 

## Repository Structure

Our documentation and project details are organized into sections available in the Wiki:

- **Home**: Introduction to the project and its objectives.
- **Milestone 2**: Details on the initial project setup and architectural design, including the conceptualization of the environment.
- **Milestone 3**: Step-by-step instructions for creating the AWS environment, including setting up VPCs, EC2 instances, and database services.
- **Milestone 4**: Focuses on implementing cloud security solutions, including encryption, IAM roles, and monitoring services.
- **Technical Summary**: A comprehensive summary that ties together the technical details and testing outcomes from all milestones.

We've also included some of the code we used:
- **index.html**: html code for web application interface
- **app.js**: javascript code to handle integrating AWS Cognito
- **lambda.py**: python code for lambda function to isolate EC2 instance

## Key Features

1. **AWS Services Utilized**: VPC, EC2, S3, WAF, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, KMS, and more.
2. **Security Enhancements**: Implemented using WAF for firewall protection, KMS for encryption, CloudWatch for monitoring, and CloudTrail for auditing.
3. **Scalability**: Infrastructure designed to accommodate varying levels of demand while maintaining security and performance.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout this project, our team gained practical experience with AWS, focusing on deploying secure, scalable cloud environments. We enhanced our skills in configuring AWS services, implementing security measures, and conducting thorough testing and monitoring.

## Conclusion

The COSC55 Final Project has been a valuable learning experience, providing insights into cloud security and architecture. Our hands-on approach has prepared us for real-world challenges in cloud computing and cybersecurity.
